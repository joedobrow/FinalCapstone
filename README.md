Book Recommender using BERT NLP on scraped Blurbs

There are 5 notebooks involved in this project:

1. EDA -- Exploratory Data Analysis. Some plots and statistics on the data I am using

2. Blurb Scraping -- The scrapy code I used to scrape the blurb data

3. Blurb Cleaning -- A lot of cleaning was required on the blurbs that I scraped in order to be used. This includes using Bert-as-a-Service to get vector embeddings of each blurb

4. Parameter Tuning -- Running the model in different circumstances to find an optimal RMSE

5. Model Execution -- Currently broken, I ran it on bad data and the results are nonsense.
